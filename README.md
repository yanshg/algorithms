# Python Algorithms and Data Structures Practice

This repository serves as a personal collection of Python implementations for a wide variety of common algorithms and data structures. It's designed for learning, reference, and interview preparation, offering practical examples of how these concepts can be applied.

## What's Inside?

The project is organized into several categories, covering key areas of computer science:

*   **Sorting Algorithms:** Implementations of various sorting techniques, including:
    *   Bubble Sort (`bubble_sort.py`)
    *   Merge Sort (`merge_sort.py`)
    *   Quick Sort (`quick_sort.py`)
    *   *(And potentially others within the main directory)*

*   **Data Structures:** Examples of fundamental data structures, such as:
    *   Binary Max Heap (`binary_max_heap.py`)

*   **Hashing Algorithms:** A collection of hashing functions, located in the `hashes/` directory:
    *   FNV1 (`hashes/FNV1.py`)
    *   DJB2 (`hashes/DJB2.py`)

*   **Graph Algorithms:** Implementations of algorithms for graph traversal and analysis, for example:
    *   A\* Shortest Path (`misc/A_star_shortest_path.py`)

*   **Dynamic Programming (DP):** A significant number of solutions to classic DP problems can be found in the `misc/` directory, typically prefixed with `DP_`. These include:
    *   Coin Change
    *   Knapsack Problem
    *   Longest Common Subsequence
    *   *(And many more)*

*   **Concurrency and Threading:** Examples demonstrating concurrent programming concepts within the `thread/` directory:
    *   FizzBuzz using threads (`thread/fizzbuzz.py`)
    *   Daemon Threads (`thread/daemon_thread.py`)

*   **Miscellaneous Algorithms and Coding Problems:** The `misc/` directory is also home to a large variety of other algorithms and solutions to common coding problems, covering areas such as:
    *   Two-pointer techniques
    *   String manipulation
    *   Tree traversal (e.g., Lowest Common Ancestor - LCA)
    *   *(And numerous other problems)*

## Purpose

This repository is intended to be a growing resource for:
*   **Learning:** Understanding how different algorithms and data structures work by examining their implementations.
*   **Practice:** Providing a codebase for practicing problem-solving skills.
*   **Reference:** Offering quick refreshers on common algorithms and their Python implementations.
*   **Interview Preparation:** Serving as a study aid for technical interviews.

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own learning and development.
