Queue - A synchronized queue class
https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html



Queue.task_done()

Indicate that a formerly enqueued task is complete. Used by queue consumer threads. For each get() used to fetch a task, a subsequent call to task_done() tells the queue that the processing on the task is complete.

If a join() is currently blocking, it will resume when all items have been processed (meaning that a task_done() call was received for every item that had been put() into the queue).

shutdown(immediate=True) calls task_done() for each remaining item in the queue.

Raises a ValueError if called more times than there were items placed in the queue.

Queue.join()
Blocks until all items in the queue have been gotten and processed.

The count of unfinished tasks goes up whenever an item is added to the queue. The count goes down whenever a consumer thread calls task_done() to indicate that the item was retrieved and all work on it is complete. When the count of unfinished tasks drops to zero, join() unblocks.

Example of how to wait for enqueued tasks to be completed:

'''

import threading
import queue

q = queue.Queue()

def worker():
    while True:
        item = q.get()
        print(f'Working on {item}')
        print(f'Finished {item}')
        q.task_done()

# Turn-on the worker thread.
threading.Thread(target=worker, daemon=True).start()

# Send thirty task requests to the worker.
for item in range(30):
    q.put(item)

# Block until all tasks are done.
q.join()
print('All work completed')
