'''
The Robot Room Cleaner problem on LeetCode involves controlling a robot to clean an entire room represented as an m x n binary grid. The robot can move forward, turn left, or turn right, and it uses a bumper sensor to detect obstacles. The challenge is to design an algorithm that allows the robot to clean every accessible cell in the room without knowing the room’s layout or the robot’s initial position.

Here’s a brief overview of the problem:

Grid Representation: The room is modeled as a grid where 0 represents a wall and 1 represents an empty slot.
Robot’s Capabilities: The robot can move forward, turn left, turn right, and clean the current cell.
Objective: Use the robot to clean all accessible cells in the room.

# You should not implement it, or speculate about its implementation.
